File 0-linear.c - searches for a valuei n an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm  
File 1-binary.c - searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm  
File 2-O - time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array
of size n  
File 3-O - space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search
algorithm in an array of size n
